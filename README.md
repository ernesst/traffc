# traffc

This is just a minimalistic web page using Google Maps traffic layer to visualize your location jam condition.

There is lot of existing similar service, and may be more sophisticated, but I was totally botherd by the design and the ads.


## Demo
The site is available [traffc.hatemzidi.com](http://traffc.hatemzidi.com/)
