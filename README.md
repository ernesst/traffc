# traffc: your road companion - ![status](https://img.shields.io/codeship/e90f5b40-c196-0132-3cad-3eb2295b72b3/master.svg)

This is just a minimalistic web page using Google Maps to ~~quickly~~ visualize your location's traffic condition.

There are a lot of existing similar services, web pages or mobile apps, and they are may be more sophisticated, but I was totally bothered by their design and the ads.
I needed something simple, minimalistic and yet light to render on any web browser (desktop, mobile ...)

traffc is a full html page, with almost no backend, except for the city-searching part.
